   <p>HTML is tolerant of grammatical errors. So even if you get an error,
     such as missing a closing tag or a typo in a tag, you can chew and work to some extent.
      Of course, only to some extent. If you make a typo in an important tag, such as a
     tag, your site layout may be broken. Even if you don't have the HTML5 standard format
     HTML above, you can simply write Hello World! In some cases, the output is as intended.
     Of course, in debug mode, you'll get an error saying this is wrong.
     If the ! DOCTYPE declaration at the top of the HTML is missing,
      the story is very different, in which case the browser interprets
      the HTML document in Quirks mode and renders it.
