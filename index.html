  <p>Tim Berners-Lee, a service based on the information management system presented
    in the 1980s, was organized around Hypertext. At that time, Berners-Lee saw a high
    rate of loss of documents including the results of previous experiments due to
    frequent personnel relocation at CERN. Proposed through. WWW can basically be
    defined as a collection of hypertext-based linked documents. These documents
    are written in Hypertext Mark-up Language (HTML) and use HTTP as the default protocol.
